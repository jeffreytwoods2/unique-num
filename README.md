#### Overview

This app takes any number you send it, queries the database to see if it's unique, and lets you know how it went!
If your number is unique, it gets added to the database. If not, you get called out (and your number is not added).

<hr>

#### Why?

I needed to learn how to deploy a Mongo database to Heroku. I also eventually want to use React to send a small component
to the page, instead of serving an entire html page just to give you your result.

#### How to Use

Simply type a number into the text field and send it! If you type anything other than a number, your entry will not send.
